			I could not confirm that an employee from an electronic company received my e-mail.<br>
			So i called him twice. I felt his voice was irritated a bit.<br>
			But fortunately he told me he got my e-mail anyway and there was no conflict.

			In my company, my senior sent a message. In it, there were acrylic plates to be carried.<br>
			So i went to the room where she was. But there was no plates.<br>
			My senior said to me that some people carried them. I felt her voice was tired.
