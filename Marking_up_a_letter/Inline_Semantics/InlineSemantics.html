			<li>The names of the sender and receiver (and Tel and Email) should be marked up with strong importance.</li>
			<li>The four dates in the document should have appropriate elements containing machine-readable dates.</li>
			<li>The first address and first date in the letter should have a class attribute value of sender-column.</li>
			<li>The CSS you'll add later will cause these to be right aligned, as it should be in the case in a classic letter layout.</li>
			<li>
				Mark up the following five acronyms/abbreviations in the main text of the letter;
				— "PhD," "HTML," "CSS," "BC," and "Esq." — to provide expansions of each one.
			</li>
			<li>
				The six sub/superscripts should be marked up appropriately;
				— in the chemical formulae, and the numbers 103 and 104 (they should be 10 to the power of 3 and 4, respectively).
			</li>
			<li>Try to mark up at least two appropriate words in the text with strong importance/emphasis.</li>
			<li>
				There are two places where the letter should have a hyperlink.
				Add appropriate links with titles.
				For the location that the links point to, you may use <a href="http://example.com">this website</a> as the URL.
			</li>
			<li>Mark up the university motto quote and citation with appropriate elements.</li>
